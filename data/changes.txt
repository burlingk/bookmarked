* Created a default index page that displays if no bookmark is chosen.
  For now, it just shows a list of existing bookmarks.  Eventually, that
  might not be what we want, but it works for now.

13 February 2018:
* Initial working version in place.
* bookmarks app created.
* Bookmark class created taking a site and a label/slug.
* bookmarks.views.go_to_site created to redirect to the site.
